# SelfDriving-Java

Most autombile manufactures and many technology companies have been working on bringing driverless vehicles to the roads for many years now. "Autonomous vehicles"
hold the promies of dramatically decreasing road congestion while also signifcantly reducing the number and severity of crashes.

With these beneifts comes a challenge: what should driveless vehicles do in dangerous situations that involve inevitable harm? The algorithms that control an 
autonomous vehicle's decision would function like the ethics of human driver.

In this project, I try to identify some of the factors that might go into those decisions.
